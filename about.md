Welcome to the "Keep yourself hydrated" app, that was developed for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. 

This app helps you to keep hydrated calculating how much water you have to drink every day based on weight and activity level.

You just need to input your weight (choosing unit: kg/lbs) and how many minutes of activity you perform each day.

The result is how many ounces or liters of water you need to drink every day to keep yourself hydrated.

Enjoy

P.S. You can find the source code for ui.R and server.R at https://github.com/smagarotto/DevDataProducts.
